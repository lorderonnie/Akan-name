## Description
   This web application was specifically made to show a person's name according to the Ghananian culture. 

   In Ghana people are named after the days of the week. An example is professor Kwame Nkurumah(the first president of Ghana) who was born on a saturday 21st september 1909. The name 'kwame' means saturday.

   This application will offer you an additional information of the specific day of the week which your were born and give you your Akan name.

## Known Bugs
  None so far.
## Technologies Used
  HTML:I used a html file to run down the codes required. I also added some font links to make it better.

  CSS:I made a custom stylesheet that has styled the eb application.I used a background image and new fonts.

  JS:I used javascript to make the application work.


## BDD
 I was able to apply all the required skills needed in the javascript.
 The application rins down a smooth path of variables and a series of connections in the javascript console to be able to come up with the right answer.
