## Description
   This web application was specifically made to show a person's name according to the Ghananian culture. 

   In Ghana people are named after the days of the week. An example is professor Kwame Nkurumah(the first president of Ghana) who was born on a saturday 21st september 1909. The name 'kwame' means saturday.

   This application will offer you an additional information of the specific day of the week which your were born and give you your Akan name.
